The graph categorizes the family dynamics into three groups: \"Co-wives,\" \"Children,\" and \"Children old enough for school.\" The data presented shows that there is a higher number of children (5) and children old enough for school (4) in families without husbands, compared to the number of co-wives, which is significantly lower (slightly over 1). This suggests that the absence of a husband correlates with having more children, both in general and school-aged.",
